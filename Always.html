                Baby, baby<br>
                There will always be a space for you and me<br>
                Right where you left it<br>
                And just maybe<br>
                Enough time will pass<br>
                We'll look back and laugh<br>
                Just don't forget it<br>
                <br>
                And maybe I'm wrong<br>
                For writing this song<br>
                Losing my head over you<br>
                <br>
                And I'll be here<br>
                'Cause we both know how it goes<br>
                I don't want things to change<br>
                I pray they stay the same always<br>
                And I don't care<br>
                If you're with somebody else<br>
                I'll give you time and space<br>
                Just know I'm not a phase<br>
                I'm always, ways, ways<br>
                Always, ways, ways<br>
                I'm always, ways, ways<br>
                <br>
                Pretty lady, used to walk with me<br>
                Down Bloor street, oh, what a time<br>
                And I still remember the fussin', the fightin', the fuckin', the lyin'<br>
                It's all fine, you'll always be mine<br>
                <br>
                And maybe I'm wrong (hey, babe, you could)<br>
                For writing this song (write me a song)<br>
                Losing my head over you<br>
                <br>
                And I'll be here<br>
                'Cause we both know how it goes<br>
                I don't want things to change<br>
                I pray they stay the same always<br>
                And I don't care<br>
                If you're with somebody else<br>
                I'll give you time and space<br>
                Just know I'm not a phase<br>
                I'm always, ways, ways<br>
                Always, ways, ways<br>
                I'm always, ways, ways<br>
                <br>
                Always, can count on it sure as the stars in the sky<br>
                Always, you can count on it sure as the stars in the sky<br>
                Always, my love for you ain't goin' nowhere<br>
                Always, I will be here<br>
