                Hold on, hold on, fuck that<br>
                Fuck that shit<br>
                Hold on, I got to start this motherfuckin' record over again<br>
                Wait a minute<br>
                Fuck that shit<br>
                Still on this motherfuckin' record<br>
                I'ma play this motherfucka for y'all<br>
                Ayy, y'all get some more drinks goin' on<br>
                I'll sound a whole lot better<br>
                <br>
                Listen<br>
                Seeing you got ritualistic<br>
                Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now<br>
                'Cause I'm fallin' apart<br>
                Yeah, tension<br>
                Between us just like picket fences<br>
                You got issues that I won't mention for now<br>
                'Cause we're fallin' apart<br>
                <br>
                Passionate from miles away<br>
                Passive with the things you say<br>
                Passin' up on my old ways<br>
                I can't blame you, no, no<br>
                Passionate from miles away<br>
                Passive with the things you say<br>
                Passin' up on my old ways<br>
                I can't blame you, no, no<br>
                <br>
                Listen<br>
                Harder buildin' trust from a distance<br>
                I think we should rule out commitment for now<br>
                'Cause we're fallin' apart<br>
                Leavin'<br>
                You're just doing that to get even<br>
                Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now<br>
                They keep fallin' apart<br>
                <br>
                Passionate from miles away<br>
                Passive with the things you say<br>
                Passin' up on my old ways<br>
                I can't blame you, no, no<br>
                Passionate from miles away<br>
                Passive with the things you say<br>
                Passin' up on my old ways<br>
                I can't blame you, no, no<br>
                <br>
                Um, trying to think of the right thing to say<br>
