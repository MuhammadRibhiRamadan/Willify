              You are the reason<br />
              The reason I sing<br />
              I have to preserve you<br />
              Cause you're my everything<br />
              Babe I know I fucked up<br />
              Focus on them B cups<br />
              'Cause you got your friends too<br />
              Better believe in it<br />
              Truth I'm up on my luck<br />
              Can't stop running amok<br />
              But you got your friends too<br />
              <br />
              I just want to thank you for saving my life, yes<br />
              I just want to thank you for all your advice<br />
              <br />
              You are the reason, the reason I'm alive<br />
              I must bring you honour<br />
              If I don't, I'd die<br />
              I know I brought shame<br />
              Put a mock on your name<br />
              But you got your thanks too, better believe it I<br />
              Rising up from the flame<br />
              The phoenix that I became<br />
              But you got your thanks too<br />
              <br />
              I just want to thank you for giving me life yes<br />
              I just want to thank you for all your advice<br />
              <br />
              Send me kisses when it's grey skies<br />
              It's been so long look how time flies<br />
              If you love me won't you let me know<br />
              I've been trying to learn let you go<br />
              Call my name whenever tears fall<br />
              When you face your fears you stand tall<br />
              <br />
              Send me kisses when it's grey skies<br />
              It's been so long look how time flies<br />
              If you love me won't you let me know<br />
              I've been trying to learn let you go<br />
              Call my name whenever tears fall<br />
              When you face your fears you stand tall<br />
              <br />
              Know I'd take a bullet for you<br />
              No you don't know what I go through<br />
              And I know you think you're kinda nice<br />
              Do you remember when I saved your life<br />
              Don't come at me on some weak shit<br />
              It's time you stopped displaying weakness, oh, oh<br />
              <br />
              Hey momma<br />
              It's your second son the same I ain't changed momma<br />
              I made some change<br />
              Times have changed on me<br />
              Times have changed (minds have changed)<br />
              My mind feel strange momma but I feel the same<br />
              I feel ashamed when I'm face to face with my faith<br />
              Face to face with my faith momma, I lost my faith<br />
              <br />
              Isn't it nice<br />
              Human sacrifice<br />
              The universe got it<br />
              I got too excited<br />
              And now we're taking life<br />
              Isn't it nice<br />
              Human sacrifice<br />
              I hate consequences, that shit is too expensive<br />
              You keep chasing delight<br />
              Isn't it nice<br />
              Human sacrifice<br />
              I take the easy way out every time<br />
              I don't deserve my own life<br />
              Isn't it nice<br />
              Human sacrifice oh yes<br />
              Say I'm a martyr<br />
              Charge that to my ego<br />
              I just want all the lights<br />
