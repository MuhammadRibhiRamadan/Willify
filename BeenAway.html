              I know I've been away<br />
              I'm just tryna get my papers straight, girl<br />
              Don't give my shit away<br />
              I'm just tryna get my papers straight, girl<br />
              <br>
              I know I've been away<br />
              I'm just tryna get my papers straight, girl<br />
              Don't give my shit away<br />
              I'm just tryna get my papers straight, girl<br />
              <br>
              They just wanna fuck with you<br />
              'Cause they know I fuck with you<br />
              If I put my trust in you<br />
              What would you do?<br />
              <br>
              Would you just step out?<br />
              Would you thug it out?<br />
              Would you be here 'til the end?<br />
              I just wanna know if you're my friend<br />
              I just wanna know if you're pretending<br />
              I know I've been away<br />
              I'm just tryna get my papers straight, girl<br />
              Don't give my shit away<br />

              Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby<br />
              Don't leave me down<br />
              Don't do me wrong<br />
              'Cause I ain't got no one at all<br />
              This penthouse view ain't as beautiful as you<br />
              Won't ever have time, but I can make time for you<br />
              Before I used to tell lies, but I would never lie to you<br />
              Shopping spree on my dime, looking all kinds of new<br />
              Girl, you know what I like, what would you like to do<br />
              Tell me, tell me, attend to you<br />
              I know I've been away (away)<br />
              I'm just tryna get my papers straight, girl<br />
              Don't give my shit away<br />
              I'm just tryna get my papers straight, girl<br />
              (No, no, no, no)<br />
              I know I've been away (I've been away)<br />
              I'm just tryna get my papers straight, girl<br />
              Don't give my shit away<br />
              I'm just tryna get my papers straight, girl<br />
              Keep me out your mind<br />
              I'm for real<br />
              Keep me out your mind<br />
              I'm for real<br />
              Keep me out your mind (for real)<br />
              Ooh, keep me out your mind<br />
