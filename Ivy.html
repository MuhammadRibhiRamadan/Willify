              I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me<br />
              The start of nothin'<br />
              I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'<br />
              The start of nothin'<br />
              Ooh, I could hate you now<br />
              It's quite alright to hate me now<br />
              When we both know that deep down<br />
              The feeling still deep down is good<br />
              <br />
              If I could see through walls<br />
              I could see you're faking<br />
              If you could see my thoughts<br />
              You would see our faces<br />
              Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then<br />
              <br />
              We didn't give a fuck back then<br />
              I ain't a kid no more<br />
              We'll never be those kids again<br />
              We'd drive to Syd's, had the back then<br />
              Back then<br />
              <br />
              No matter what I did<br />
              My waves wouldn't dip back then<br />
              Everything sucked back then<br />
              We were friends<br />
              <br />
              I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you loved me<br />
              The start of nothin'<br />
              I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'<br />
              The start of nothin'<br />
              Ooh, I could hate you now<br />
              It's quite alright to hate me now<br />
              But we both know that deep down<br />
              The feeling still deep down is good<br />
              <br />
              In the halls of your hotel<br />
              Arm around my shoulder so I could tell<br />
              How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then<br />
              We had time to kill back then<br />
              You ain't a kid no more<br />
              We'll never be those kids again<br />
              It's not the same, ivory's illegal<br />
              Don't you remember?<br />
              <br />
              I broke your heart last week<br />
              You'll probably feel better by the weekend<br />
              Still remember, had you going crazy<br />
              Screamin' my name<br />
              The feeling deep down is good<br />
              <br />
              I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you loved me<br />
              The start of nothin'<br />
              I had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'<br />
              And we started from nothin'<br />
              Ooh, I could hate you now<br />
              It's alright to hate me now<br />
              We both know that deep down<br />
              The feeling still deep down is good<br />
              <br />
              All the things I didn't mean to say<br />
              I didn't mean to do<br />
              There were things you didn't need to say<br />
              Did you mean to? Mean to?<br />
              I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you<br />
              I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you<br />
              I've been dreamin', dreamin'
