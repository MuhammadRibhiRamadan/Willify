              Thought I almost died in my dream again (baby, almost died)<br />
              Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again<br />
              I'm fallin' in too deep (oh)<br />
              Without you, don't wanna sleep (fallin' in)<br />
              'Cause my heart belongs to you<br />
              I'll risk it all for you<br />
              I want you next to me<br />
              This time, I'll never leave<br />
              I wanna share babies<br />
              Protection, we won't need<br />
              Your body next to me<br />
              Is just a memory<br />
              I'm fallin' in too deep, oh<br />
              Without you, I can't sleep<br />
              Insomnia relieve, oh<br />
              Talk to me, without you I can't breathe<br />
              <br>
              My darkest hours<br />
              Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room<br />
              Different girls on the floor, distracting my thoughts of you<br />
              I turned into the man I used to be, to be<br />
              Put myself to sleep<br />
              Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams<br />
              Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me<br />
              I just wanted to call you and say, and say<br />
              <br>
              Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?<br />
              I'd give it all just to hold you close<br />
              Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart<br />
              <br>
              Never comin' down, uh<br />
              I was runnin' away from facin' reality, uh<br />
              Wastin' all of my time on livin' my fantasies<br />
              Spendin' money to compensate, compensate<br />
              'Cause I want you baby<br />
              I'll be livin' in Heaven when I'm inside of you<br />
              It was definitely a blessing wakin' beside you<br />
              I'll never let you down again, again<br />
              <br>
              Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?<br />
              I'd give it all just to hold you close<br />
              Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart<br />
              I said, baby, I'll treat you better than I did before<br />
              I'll hold you down and not let you go<br />
              This time I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah<br />
              <br>
              I know it's all my fault<br />
              Made you put down your guard<br />
              I know I made you fall<br />
              Then said you were wrong for me<br />
              I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (to you)<br />
              Can't hide the truth, I stayed with her in spite of you<br />
              You did some things that you regret, still ride for you<br />
              'Cause this house is not a home<br />
              <br>
              Without my baby, where are you now when I need you most?<br />
              I gave it all just to hold you close<br />
              Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart<br />
              And I said, baby, I'll treat you better than I did before<br />
              I'll hold you down and not let you go<br />
              This time I won't break your heart, your heart, no<br />
